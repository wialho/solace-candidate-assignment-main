## Solace Candidate Assignment

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## env setup

copy .env.example and remove the .example. Optionally update your env or use the preset values for local development. Optionally configure nextjs env files (https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/environment-variables#environment-variable-load-order)

## Database set up

The app is configured to return a default list of advocates. This will allow you to get the app up and running without needing to configure a database. Uncomment the line in `src/app/api/advocates/route.ts` to test retrieving advocates from the database.

1. Feel free to use whatever configuration of postgres you like. The project is set up to use docker-compose.yml to set up postgres. The url is in .env.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

2. Log into pg4admin at localhost:5050, user = admin@admin.com, password = admin

3. Create a `solaceassignment` database.

4. Push migration to the database

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

5. Seed the database

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/seed
```
